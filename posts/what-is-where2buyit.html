  <h2>What is <a href="https://where2buy.it">where2buy.it?</a></h2>
  <p>Here's a brief description and roadmap of the project I am working on. </p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
  <a href="https://where2buy.it">Where2buy.it</a> is a search engine for products sold in physical stores.
  Users perform searches and find where specific products are sold and by which price.
  The search engine allows finding words appearing directly into Restaurants Menu's content.
</p>
<p>
  Finding products is not all, as most important is to find the best products.
  That's why the platform uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">Sentiment Analysis</a> to read products' reviews that users have published online.
  Not all reviews are selected, but only the public ones that mention the specific product for that
  restaurant.
  Sentiment Analysis analyzes human language written in the phrases and determines if the customer experience was positive or negative.
  So the search engine can forecast the probability of a negative customer experience for that product.
  When a user searches, the platform shows first the results that minimize the chance of a negative customer experience.
</p>

<h3>Personal philosophy:</h3>
<p>
  My name is <a href="https://eracle.me">Antonio Ercole De Luca</a>.
  I am running this project without external funding and following methodologies borrowed from the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie hackers community</a>.
  Don't accepting any external funding is more a lifestyle choice.
  Technology has achieved enough potential that we can pretty much do everything with software without the need for external help.
  Silicon Valley's way of doing startups is stressful for CEO and founders.
  That is not how I want to live my life.
</p>
<p>
  Another fallacy in Venture Capital funded startups is that external money can subsidize and make up fictional growth for a product that doesn't create value for anybody.
  If the product creates value, the market will show organically.
  If it doesn't, better work on the next idea.
</p>
<p>
  I will work on some additional features and let the market validate the idea.
  Next feature is to give users quantitative market metrics about products.
  For that, products pages will show some dashboards like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>sentiment analysis score over time;</li>
  <li>where the product's price lies towards its competitors;</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Last feature I will implement is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki-style management</a> of Restaurants' menus.
  In other words, the menu's content will be open and editable by every user, very similar to Wikipedia pages.
  Every user will have the possibility to add, remove or modify products entries inside restaurants menus.
</p>
<h3>Market Differentiation:</h3>
<p>
  Other actors doing similar things out there:
  <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants">Tripadvisor</a>, <a href="https://www.thefork.com/">TheFork</a>, <a href="https://restaurantguru.com/">RestaurantGuru</a> (and now <a href="https://where2buy.it">where2buy.it</a>).
  The differentiating factor here is to operate on a different data granularity:
  the main focus of this platform is to allow users to discover good food/products.
  In contrast with the other actors, my focus is not on restaurants but good products.
  Most of those companies lack at least one of those points:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>having any single product level detail on their searches; </li>
  <li>having products' prices;</li>
  <li>analyzing products sentiments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After market-validation:</h3>
<p>
  Having users will be the first step for market validation.
  After that, the business must achieve financial sustainability.
  The main form of wealth the platform creates is bringing customers to restaurants.
</p>

<p>
  The dashboard will be part of the freemium plan, and as a premium plan,
  restaurant owners will be able to advertise their listings first on the search engine results page:
  The same model as <a href="https://ads.google.com/">Google Search Ads</a>.
</p>
<h3>Future directions:</h3>
<p>
  In the beginning, we had food and restaurants data.
  The future will allow us to track every single product available out there.
  It's only a matter of data availability and integration.
  Grocery stores will sync their data about inventory's availability directly with the platform.
</p>
<p>
  Another direction is to include farmers and remote producers in the platform.
  The users will select by production place, price and sentiment.
  In this case, the platform could provide an optional shipping service that can allow users to buy online directly from rural producers.
</p>
<p>
  But maybe I am going too forward, for now.
