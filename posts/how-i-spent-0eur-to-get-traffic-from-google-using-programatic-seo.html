    In this post, I explain how I used Programmatic SEO to get some traffic from Google's search engines for the most
    recent product I created: a search engine for food sold in physical stores.
</p>


<h4>Let's start from the basics:</h4>
<p>
    Programmatic SEO is a technique used in the field of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Like many other SEO
    practices, it aims to improve the quality and quantity of web traffic from search engines.
    It consists of the automatic generation of static pages that contain a direct link to your landing page or
    are one click away from your product's core feature.

<h4>What we need:</h4>
<p>
    The technique uses a database and a templated HTML page to generate the pages. The database should contain
    the keywords you want to rank for on Google. For instance, you can start from a list of long-tail keywords
    or the list of cities where you sell your product.
</p>

<p>
    The template should allow you to use variables inside your HTML, so they can be substituted using the data from your
    database.

    One detail about your database: you should also have some content specifically related to the keyword you are using.
    For instance, if you use keywords related to cities, you can include other information like the name of its region,
    nation or some text unique to that city. The objective is to obtain every page different from all the other pages.
    The reason is that Google ignores pages that are too similar to other pages it already indexes.
</p>

<h4>Which tools I used:</h4>
<p>
    I used the Django template system to build the HTML pages. Of course, there are already no-code tools you can use on
    the Internet, like Webflow.
    I wrote a python script that generates the information needed to render the page through the template using keywords
    read from a database.
</p>

<h4>Database content:</h4>
<p>
    In my database, I store different entities:
    The Cities, the Restaurants and the Products sold in those restaurants.
    I got the Cities data for free simply by using Django and its ecosystem of open-source pluggable apps, which solved
    many of my problems. I used Django-cities-light, which automagically downloads the data of all the cities in the
    world and stores them in my database. It also provides the hierarchy of City, Region and Nation.
    I got Restaurants and Products data from the Internet.
</p>

<h4>Rankings:</h4>
<p>
    I wanted a procedure to identify the best products for each specific category in a city. For instance, I wanted to
    know the best pizzas in Naples. So I realized that I could read reviews and use sentiment analysis on each review.
    That's fine, but the reviews are usually associated with a restaurant:
</p>
<img src="/images/prog_seo/restau_reviews.png" alt="" alt="Restaurant Reviews" class="image"/>
<p>
    So I wrote a simple python program that analyzed every restaurant's review and identified which products it was
    mentioning.
</p>

<p>
    I compute an average sentiment score for each product and sort them accordingly.
</p>

<h4>Generated Pages:</h4>
<p>
    The pages generated for the sake of programmatic SEO are simply ranking pages. They are pages containing an ordered
    list of products sorted by specific metrics. For instance: price. For each category and city, I generated a list of
    the cheapest products sold in that city.
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://where2buy.it/cheapest-focaccia-bari">Cheapest Focaccia in Bari</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="https://where2buy.it/most-expensive-pizza-reggio-calabria">Most expensive Pizza in Reggio Calabria</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="https://where2buy.it/best-pizza-naples/">Best Pizza in Naples</a>;</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> Results:</h4>
<p>
    Results are ok, considering I knew almost nothing about SEO techniques.
    I still have to finish filling my database with all Italian cities, but having 4000 impressions and ten visitors per
    day is not bad, considering I only coded some software.
    Anyway, I am sure there are other tricks to increase even more my SEO, which can be a future starting point.
