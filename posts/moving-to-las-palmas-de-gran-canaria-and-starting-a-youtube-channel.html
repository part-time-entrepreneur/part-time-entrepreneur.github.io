<h1>Moving to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Starting a YouTube Channel</h1>
<p>In 2022, I made the decision to leave Italy and move to the beautiful city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The main
    reasons for my move were the fantastic weather and the thriving digital nomad community. I believe that in the
    future, we will all work less and more people will choose to work remotely from places that offer good living
    standards, like Europe.</p>
<p>Once I arrived in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, I was inspired to start a youtube channel. My channel, which is a video
    podcast, features interviews with successful digital entrepreneurs. I ask them about their journey to success and
    the struggles they faced along the way. My goal is to create a resource that is both educational and
    motivational.</p>
<p>I believe that learning new skills is becoming increasingly automated, but the decision to learn something new often
    comes from seeing someone else's success. That's why my channel is also a motivational resource. I want to help
    people thrive in the digital revolution and avoid being replaced by new technologies, like AI.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing the stories and experiences of successful entrepreneurs, my channel also offers tips and
    strategies for building a successful career in the digital world. I believe that by learning from the experiences of
    others and taking action on what we know, we can avoid being left behind in the rapidly changing world of
    technology.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning from successful digital entrepreneurs and finding the motivation to thrive in the
    digital age, follow me on Twitter and Youtube. I post regular updates and engaging content to help you on your
    journey.</p>
