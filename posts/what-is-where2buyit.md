# What is where2buy.it

Where2buy.it is a website that uses natural language processing techniques to extract meaningful information from
[reviews on Amazon](https://where2buy.it) and then writes articles about specific products based on this information to help consumers make
informed purchasing decisions.
The website was originally focused on restaurant reviews but pivoted to product reviews due to a lack of a solid
business model. The website's software scans through reviews, looking for keywords and patterns that indicate what users
like and dislike about a particular product and generates a summary of the review highlighting the most important
points. Currently, the website only writes articles in English, but plans to expand to other languages in the future.

It aims to help users make informed purchasing decisions while reducing the time and effort they spend researching
products. It utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing techniques to extract valuable information from user reviews
on Amazon, which is then presented in the form of detailed product reviews. The website's philosophy is to work smarter,
not harder, and it does so by automating the research process, allowing users to spend less time researching products
and more time enjoying the things they love. It is an example of how technology can be used to make our lives easier.
