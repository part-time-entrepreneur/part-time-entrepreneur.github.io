    <h3>How I spent 0€ to get traffic from Google using Programmatic SEO</h3>
    <p>How I used it on getting first traffic with <a href="https://where2buy.it">Where2buy.it</a></p>
</div>
<br><p>
    In this post, I explain how I used Programmatic SEO to get some traffic from Google's search engines for the most
    recent product I created: a search engine for food sold in physical stores.
</p>


<h4>Let's start from the basics:</h4>
<p>
    Programmatic SEO is a technique used in the field of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Like many other SEO
    practices, it aims to improve the quality and quantity of web traffic from search engines.
    It consists of the automatic generation of static pages that contain a direct link to your landing page or
    are one click away from your product's core feature.
</p>
<img src="images/prog_seo/cities.png" alt="" class="image"><h4>What we need:</h4>
<p>
    The technique uses a database and a templated HTML page to generate the pages. The database should contain
    the keywords you want to rank for on Google. For instance, you can start from a list of long-tail keywords
    or the list of cities where you sell your product.
</p>

<p>
    The template should allow you to use variables inside your HTML, so they can be substituted using the data from your
    database.

    <img src="images/prog_seo/template.png" alt="" class="image">
    One detail about your database: you should also have some content specifically related to the keyword you are using.
    For instance, if you use keywords related to cities, you can include other information like the name of its region,
    nation or some text unique to that city. The objective is to obtain every page different from all the other pages.
    The reason is that Google ignores pages that are too similar to other pages it already indexes.
</p>

<h4>Which tools I used:</h4>
<p>
    I used the Django template system to build the HTML pages. Of course, there are already no-code tools you can use on
    the Internet, like Webflow.
    I wrote a python script that generates the information needed to render the page through the template using keywords
    read from a database.
</p>

<h4>Database content:</h4>
<p>
    In my database, I store different entities:
    The Cities, the Restaurants and the Products sold in those restaurants.
    I got the Cities data for free simply by using Django and its ecosystem of open-source pluggable apps, which solved
    many of my problems. I used Django-cities-light, which automagically downloads the data of all the cities in the
    world and stores them in my database. It also provides the hierarchy of City, Region and Nation.
    I got Restaurants and Products data from the Internet.
</p>

<h4>Rankings:</h4>
<p>
    I wanted a procedure to identify the best products for each specific category in a city. For instance, I wanted to
    know the best pizzas in Naples. So I realized that I could read reviews and use sentiment analysis on each review.
    That's fine, but the reviews are usually associated with a restaurant:
</p>
<img src="images/prog_seo/restau_reviews.png" alt="" class="image"><p>
    So I wrote a simple python program that analyzed every restaurant's review and identified which products it was
    mentioning.
</p>
<img src="images/prog_seo/focaccia.png" alt="" class="image"><p>
    I compute an average sentiment score for each product and sort them accordingly.
</p>

<img src="images/prog_seo/product_reviews.png" alt="" class="image"><h4>Generated Pages:</h4>
<p>
    The pages generated for the sake of programmatic SEO are simply ranking pages. They are pages containing an ordered
    list of products sorted by specific metrics. For instance: price. For each category and city, I generated a list of
    the cheapest products sold in that city.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://where2buy.it/cheapest-focaccia-bari">Cheapest Focaccia in Bari</a>;</li>
    <li>
<a href="https://where2buy.it/most-expensive-pizza-reggio-calabria">Most expensive Pizza in Reggio Calabria</a>;</li>
    <li>
<a href="https://where2buy.it/best-pizza-naples/">Best Pizza in Naples</a>;</li>
</ul>
<h4> Results:</h4>
<p>
    Results are ok, considering I knew almost nothing about SEO techniques.
    I still have to finish filling my database with all Italian cities, but having 4000 impressions and ten visitors per
    day is not bad, considering I only coded some software.
    Anyway, I am sure there are other tricks to increase even more my SEO, which can be a future starting point.

  <h2>What is <a href="https://where2buy.it">where2buy.it?</a>
</h2>
  <p>Here's a brief description and roadmap of the project I am working on. </p>
</div>
<br><p>
  <a href="https://where2buy.it">Where2buy.it</a> is a search engine for products sold in physical stores.
  Users perform searches and find where specific products are sold and by which price.
  The search engine allows finding words appearing directly into Restaurants Menu's content.
</p>
<p>
  Finding products is not all, as most important is to find the best products.
  That's why the platform uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">Sentiment Analysis</a> to read products' reviews that users have published online.
  Not all reviews are selected, but only the public ones that mention the specific product for that
  restaurant.
  Sentiment Analysis analyzes human language written in the phrases and determines if the customer experience was positive or negative.
  So the search engine can forecast the probability of a negative customer experience for that product.
  When a user searches, the platform shows first the results that minimize the chance of a negative customer experience.
</p>

<h3>Personal philosophy:</h3>
<p>
  My name is <a href="https://eracle.me">Antonio Ercole De Luca</a>.
  I am running this project without external funding and following methodologies borrowed from the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie hackers community</a>.
  Don't accepting any external funding is more a lifestyle choice.
  Technology has achieved enough potential that we can pretty much do everything with software without the need for external help.
  Silicon Valley's way of doing startups is stressful for CEO and founders.
  That is not how I want to live my life.
</p>
<p>
  Another fallacy in Venture Capital funded startups is that external money can subsidize and make up fictional growth for a product that doesn't create value for anybody.
  If the product creates value, the market will show organically.
  If it doesn't, better work on the next idea.
</p>
<p>
  I will work on some additional features and let the market validate the idea.
  Next feature is to give users quantitative market metrics about products.
  For that, products pages will show some dashboards like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>sentiment analysis score over time;</li>
  <li>where the product's price lies towards its competitors;</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Last feature I will implement is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki-style management</a> of Restaurants' menus.
  In other words, the menu's content will be open and editable by every user, very similar to Wikipedia pages.
  Every user will have the possibility to add, remove or modify products entries inside restaurants menus.
</p>
<h3>Market Differentiation:</h3>
<p>
  Other actors doing similar things out there:
  <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants">Tripadvisor</a>, <a href="https://www.thefork.com/">TheFork</a>, <a href="https://restaurantguru.com/">RestaurantGuru</a> (and now <a href="https://where2buy.it">where2buy.it</a>).
  The differentiating factor here is to operate on a different data granularity:
  the main focus of this platform is to allow users to discover good food/products.
  In contrast with the other actors, my focus is not on restaurants but good products.
  Most of those companies lack at least one of those points:
</p>
<ul>
<li>having any single product level detail on their searches; </li>
  <li>having products' prices;</li>
  <li>analyzing products sentiments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After market-validation:</h3>
<p>
  Having users will be the first step for market validation.
  After that, the business must achieve financial sustainability.
  The main form of wealth the platform creates is bringing customers to restaurants.
  As a part of a premium plan, restaurant owners will be able to advertise their listings
  on the first positions on the search engine results page:
  The same model as <a href="https://ads.google.com/">Google Search Ads</a>.
</p>
<h3>Future directions:</h3>
<p>
  In the beginning, we had food and restaurants data.
  The future will allow us to track every single product available out there.
  It's only a matter of data availability and integration.
  Grocery stores will sync their data about inventory's availability directly with the platform.
</p>
<p>
  Another direction is to include farmers and remote producers in the platform.
  The users will select by production place, price and sentiment.
  In this case, the platform could provide an optional shipping service that can allow users to buy online directly from rural producers.
</p>
<p>
  But maybe I am going too forward, for now.

        <header><h3>How to keep Learning costs low as a Solo Entrepreneur</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_fast_and_break_things_(motto)">Move Fast Break
        Things</a>: that's a well known Silicon Valley's motto. </p>
</header><section><p>
        The process of starting up a new company can have the following cycle:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>express hypotheses on markets and customers;</li>
        <li>test those hypotheses in the real world;</li>
        <li>make this cycle as fast as possible.</li>
    </ul>
    Performing mistakes is not a big problem for startups, as long as it increases the most valuable
    asset: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validated_learning">validated learning</a>.
    But not all things an entrepreneur should understand are about startup's markets or customers.
    Sometimes problems they are facing were already solved by someone else out there in the world.
    Today, we have so much free knowledge on the Internet, learning a new skill seems similar to the
    famous scene in The Matrix: "Now I know Kung Fu!".
    

    <img src="images/matrix_kungfu.jpg" alt="Now I know Kung Fu!" class="image"><p>

        The objective of this blog is to explain my recipe to achieve Financial Independence and get rid
        of the obsolete full-time job scheme.
        Not everybody can do it now. For some people, that can take years of preparation. For others,
        technology is just not ready for it. But I will try to cover some points that I believe are key.
        I will present them with some practical suggestions on how-to-use low-cost tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first mandatory asset for a successful part-time entrepreneur is knowledge. We shouldn't let
        our entrepreneurial tasks devour our days. Even Warren Buffett and Bill Gates take their time to
        study and understand how the world works.
    </p>
    <h6>Books:</h6>
    <p>
    I use a Kindle DX (9 inches) to read PDFs, it was an investment, but it repaid everything.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Kindle DX model screen perfectly fits PDFs sizes and is the bigger among all Kindles Amazon
        manufactured. It is easy to read PDFs with it.
        In my opinion, its users were less prone to buy DRM covered e-books which were part of Amazon's
        business. Maybe, that could have been the cause of why Amazon manufactured all subsequent models
        with a smaller screen.
        Here's an example of how we can own automation to keep our living costs close to zero.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
<h6> Pomodoro Technique:</h6>
    <p>
        I use 25 minutes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro
        sessions</a> for study. I turn off all my devices. I do my sessions during
        my most clear-minded moments of the day and before starting any screen-related work. I love
        libraries.
    </p>
<h6>Podcasts:</h6>
    <p>
        One of the best sources for becoming a solo-entrepreneur is <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcasts">Indiehackers podcasts</a>. That's a
        valuable source of experiences and examples of successful professionals sharing experiences and
        knowledge.
        I listen to podcasts after going to bed and before falling asleep, so I will not stress my eyes
        using any screen-related artificial light.
    </p>

    <h6>Conclusions:</h6>
    <p>
        I named this blog <a href="https://part-time-entrepreneur.com">part-time entrepreneur</a>
        because I work half of my time on my <a href="https://where2buy.it">actual product</a>.
        I use the rest of my time for other activities like studying, thinking, writing, walking, doing
        sport and enjoying life.
        
        Those are all aimed at the final objective, don't waste our lives on the wrong paths: the ones
        that break things.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will share in this blog all meaningful experiences and stories that I will face during my
        journey as a solo entrepreneur.
